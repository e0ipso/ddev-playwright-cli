## Overview

This add-on installs [`@playwright/cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@playwright/cli) globally in the DDEV web container along with its bundled Chromium browser, and automatically installs Claude Code skills on container start.

[Playwright CLI](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-cli) is a
token-efficient command-line tool designed for AI coding agents such as Claude
Code, GitHub Copilot, and Cursor. It lets agents interact with Playwright
browsers through simple shell commands instead of writing full test scripts.

What this add-on does:

- Installs `@playwright/cli` and Chromium at Docker build time via `web-build/Dockerfile.playwright-cli` with Docker build cache for fast rebuilds
- Runs `playwright-cli install --skills` automatically via a post-start hook to install Claude Code skills

## Installation

```bash
ddev add-on get e0ipso/ddev-playwright-cli
ddev restart
```

After installation, commit the `.ddev` directory to version control.

## Usage

All Playwright CLI commands are available through `ddev exec playwright-cli`:

```console
# Open a URL in the browser.
ddev exec playwright-cli open https://example.ddev.site

# Take a snapshot of the current page (returns an accessibility tree).
ddev exec playwright-cli snapshot

# Click an element, fill a field, etc.
ddev exec playwright-cli click --selector "text=Log in"
ddev exec playwright-cli fill --selector "#edit-name" --value admin
```
